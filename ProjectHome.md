An application for performing a dictionary attack on encrypted volumes. Basically a wrapper around FreeOTFE, which also supports Linux volumes (Cryptoloop, dm-crypt, LUKS).

By design these encrpytion systems are very slow to brute force, so a dictionary based attack is only appropriate for poorly chosen passphrases.

### Benefits ###
  * Check if your passphrase is secure

## How it works ##
  * Count the initial number of drives in the system
  * Loop through the input in the dictionary
    * Execute a command line statement to mount the encrypted image using the current passphrase (/mount /volume [volume](volume.md) /password [password](password.md) /silent N:\\)
    * If itâ€™s a Linux drive, use the WinAPI to automatically fill in the GUI prompt
    * When the number of drives has changed a volume has been mounted, so one of the recently tried passwords was used
